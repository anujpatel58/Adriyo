In this task, you have to add a reminder where user will put start time, time interval and repeat count. The reminder will launch a popup at the given time. This popup holds 2 buttons: "Stop" and "Snooze". By tapping on Stop button, the current reminder will be stopped and if user taps on Snooze button then the reminder will again give a notification in 10 min with the same 2 buttons (Stop and Snooze).

Ex: I set 10:00 am as start time, 3 hours as interval and repeat count is 4. So this reminder will be executed at 10 am, 1 pm, 4 pm and 7 pm. Suppose I stop the reminder at 1 pm then next reminder will be executed as previous instructed at 4 pm. Whereas, If I snooze the reminder at 1 pm, it will again remind me at 1:10 pm and then the same option appears where it can be stopped or snoozed.
